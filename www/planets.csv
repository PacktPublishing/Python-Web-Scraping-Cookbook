Mercury,0.330,4879,Named Mercurius by the Romans because it appears to move so swiftly.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(planet)
Venus,4.87,12104,"Roman name for the goddess of love. This planet was considered to be the brightest and most beautiful planet or star in the
                    heavens. Other civilizations have named it for their god or goddess of love/war.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus
Earth,5.97,12756,"The name Earth comes from the Indo-European base 'er,'which produced the Germanic noun 'ertho,' and ultimately German 'erde,'
                    Dutch 'aarde,' Scandinavian 'jord,' and English 'earth.' Related forms include Greek 'eraze,' meaning
                    'on the ground,' and Welsh 'erw,' meaning 'a piece of land.'",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth
Mars,0.642,6792,"Named by the Romans for their god of war because of its red, bloodlike color. Other civilizations also named this planet
                    from this attribute; for example, the Egyptians named it ""Her Desher,"" meaning ""the red one.""",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars
Jupiter,1898,142984,"The largest and most massive of the planets was named Zeus by the Greeks and Jupiter by the Romans; he was
                    the most important deity in both pantheons.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter
Saturn,568,120536,"Roman name for the Greek Cronos, father of Zeus/Jupiter. Other civilizations have given different names to Saturn, which
                    is the farthest planet from Earth that can be observed by the naked human eye. Most of its satellites
                    were named for Titans who, according to Greek mythology, were brothers and sisters of Saturn.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn
Uranus,86.8,51118,"Several astronomers, including Flamsteed and Le Monnier, had observed Uranus earlier but had recorded it as a fixed star.
                    Herschel tried unsuccessfully to name his discovery ""Georgian Sidus"" after George III; the planet was
                    named by Johann Bode in 1781 after the ancient Greek deity of the sky Uranus, the father of Kronos (Saturn)
                    and grandfather of Zeus (Jupiter).",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranus
Neptune,102,49528,"Neptune was ""predicted"" by John Couch Adams and Urbain Le Verrier who, independently, were able to account for the irregularities
                    in the motion of Uranus by correctly predicting the orbital elements of a trans- Uranian body. Using
                    the predicted parameters of Le Verrier (Adams never published his predictions), Johann Galle observed
                    the planet in 1846. Galle wanted to name the planet for Le Verrier, but that was not acceptable to the
                    international astronomical community. Instead, this planet is named for the Roman god of the sea.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neptune
Pluto,0.0146,2370,"Pluto was discovered at Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, AZ during a systematic search for a trans-Neptune planet predicted
                    by Percival Lowell and William H. Pickering. Named after the Roman god of the underworld who was able
                    to render himself invisible.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluto
