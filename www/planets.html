                    were named for Titans who, according to Greek mythology, were brothers and sisters of Saturn.

                    Several astronomers, including Flamsteed and Le Monnier, had observed Uranus earlier but had recorded it as a fixed star.
                    Herschel tried unsuccessfully to name his discovery "Georgian Sidus" after George III; the planet was
                    named by Johann Bode in 1781 after the ancient Greek deity of the sky Uranus, the father of Kronos (Saturn)
                    and grandfather of Zeus (Jupiter).

                    Neptune was "predicted" by John Couch Adams and Urbain Le Verrier who, independently, were able to account for the irregularities
                    in the motion of Uranus by correctly predicting the orbital elements of a trans- Uranian body. Using
                    the predicted parameters of Le Verrier (Adams never published his predictions), Johann Galle observed
                    the planet in 1846. Galle wanted to name the planet for Le Verrier, but that was not acceptable to the
                    international astronomical community. Instead, this planet is named for the Roman god of the sea.

                    Pluto was discovered at Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, AZ during a systematic search for a trans-Neptune planet predicted
                    by Percival Lowell and William H. Pickering. Named after the Roman god of the underworld who was able
                    to render himself invisible.
